            <H2>IS THERE A CORRELATION BETWEEN INTERNET USE AND MENTAL HEALTH DISORDERS?</H2>
            <p>This project aims to examine mental health disorders and analyse whether internet access and the proliferation of internet usage for young people is correlated with prevalent mental health disorders. Through the project, I would like to understand the most common disorders, those with accelerating prevalence and also demographic impact. Specifically, I would like to assess whether there is a relationship between internet usage and the mental health disorders within various parameters, such as age group and region.</p>

            <P>I generated a choropleth map with variable layers to view both mental health disorders and internet usage. The ubiquity of mental health disorders is immediately clear. Evidence from maps shows concentration of high internet usage and high mental health disorders within the European region.</P>

            <h2>Patterns in Mental Health Disorders</h2>
            <p>To begin narrowing the analysis, I wanted to assess which are the most prevalent mental health disorders, but also which has had the most significant change over time. I computed the percentage change over time and used machine learning to visualise the trend. Although anxiety disorders are the most common, eating disorders appear to have the greatest rate of change. </p>

            <h2>Is there a correlation?</h2>
            <p>To assess whether the popularity of the internet in Europe can be substantially linked to higher mental health disorders, I focused on the age groups with the greatest increase over time, 15-19 and 20-24. The linear regressions showed a positive but very weak correlation between mental health disorders and internet use for ages 15-24. Moreover, the Pearson correlation shows a strong, positive association.</p>

        <h3>Challenges in data cleaning and analysis</h3>
        <p>The IHME has a poor API integration making it difficult to get the data using XML requests, so instead, I downloaded the data locally. Although this eliminated automation, it remains replicable. For analysis, there was limited need to scrape websites as necessary datasets were readily available through local download or from an API.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, data from the World Bank API had country lettering discrepancies from the IHME datasets which significantly decreased the output, so for some values I had to manually clean the dataset and ensure the countries matched.</p>
        <p>Effective visualisation was my focus, therefore required a lot of data manipulation and extra calculations to code. For example, to analyse trends over time for mental health disorders, I had to compute relative changes as well as merging age group datasets to compile relevant information. Furthermore, I found that running linear regressions was very one dimensional, and did not contribute much in analysis, therefore I attempted to run a Pearson correlation to try and capture the relationship over time.</p>

        <h3>Conclusions</h3>
        <p>Currently there is little correlation between given mental health disorders and internet usage. However, there is evidence to suggest that for ages 15-24, growth in eating disorders and increasing internet usage could be linked. The data shows commonalities in trends between internet usage and eating disorders for young people over time. However, I have only focused on the most prevalent mental health disorders recently (anxiety disorder) and the greatest increase over time (eating disorder); there are other mental health disorders that could be assessed which may more strongly correlated. Going forward, I would want to look more closely at the relationship over time between mental health disorders and internet usage by geography.</p>
        <p>To conclude, there is a clear prevalence of mental health disorders across the globe and trends in Europe provide reason to think carefully about the implications of internet usage for young people.</p>
